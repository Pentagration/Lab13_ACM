Thirty-five miles out of noun, in the pancake-flat desert of southeast noun,
there's a patch of scrub-covered dirt that may offer a fix — albeit adverb — to one of the noun most vexing and expensive environmental problems: What to do with our adjective waste?
Despite more than 50 years of searching and billions of noun verb, the federal government still hasn't been able to identify a permanent repository for adjective material. 
No state seems to want it.
So instead, dozens of states are stuck with it. More than 80,000 metric tons of spent adjective fuel, a still-radioactive byproduct of adjective power generation, 
is spread across the country at power plants and sites in 35 states.
The issue has dogged noun for decades. Energy Secretary Rick Perry recently described the situation as a "logjam." But some hope that this remote,
rural corner of New Mexico may present a breakthrough.
The adjective Regulatory Commission is considering a proposal by Holtec International, a private U.S.-based company, to build a massive consolidated interim storage facility for spent adjective 
fuel on that patch of desert. It could eventually hold up to 100,000 metric tons of the material, storing it until a permanent repository is found.
